# Predicting-Response-to-Promotional-Campaign-

Business Strategy: In this project we are using retail data to predict clients responses to a promotional campaigns. The aim of this project is to strategically target customers with campaings based on their spending trends, helping businesses be more successful on their marketing trends. 

This is an example of Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value (RFM) in marketing: a tool used to identufy the firms best clients based on the nature of their spending habits.
In particular, it evaluates customersâ€™ recency (how long ago they made a purchase), frequency (how often they make purchases), and monetary value (how much money they spend)

 Machine Learning algorithms are applied to retail data that captures annual and monthly spending trends.The steps of this projecy are:

1. Data analysis and time series feature generation in initial_data_analysis.ipynb
2. Training classification models and selecting the best model in comparing_algorithms.ipynb
3. Optimizing the best model in performance_analysis.ipynb
4. Deploying the best model and monitoring its performance in model.py
